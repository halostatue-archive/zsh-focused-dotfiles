# halostatue's Zsh Configuration

This repository has my (fairly extensive) configuration files and standard
scripts that I use for everything except vim configuration on Unixish hosts
(primarily Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux). My vim configuration is a separate
[repository][vim-config] for historical and practical reasons (it has been used
on Windows in the past and may still work).

[vim-config]: https://github.com/halostatue/vim-config/

## Prerequisites

* Ruby 1.9.3 or later
* Rake 10.0 or later

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/halostatue/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    bin/halozsh bootstrap

### Template Files

Files can be installed in one of two ways: linking or template generation. A
*template* file is one that will be run through `erb` to evaluate the contents
of the file. The output will be written as the install target.

A method `include_file` is available to include the contents of another file
(included files are automatically treated like template files). Relative paths
may be given to `include_file`; they will be expanded (using `expand_path`) on
use. If the `include_file` path includes the string `{PLATFORM}`, it will be
replaced with the equivalent of `uname | tr A-Z a-z`.

Files that are installed by template are given named tasks, in the `file`
namespace:

    rake file:gitconfig   # Includes: ~/.github-token, platform/gitconfig.darwin
    rake file:hgrc        # Includes: platform/hgrc.darwin
    rake file:ssh-config  # Includes: ~/.ssh-home, ~/.ssh-work

> NOTE: Template files do not have `%` processing enabled when processed
> through ERB. Only `<%= â€¦ %>` tags are recognized.

## Features

There are tons of features. One of these days, I'll document them all.

### Ordered startup

Some startup is provided for the zsh environment and is controlled by the names
of the files in `zsh/rc.d`. Startup within the `.zshrc` is fairly ordered.

### Plugins

There's a plug-in system to load functionality only when the prerequisites are
present. Plug-ins are not guaranteed to load in any particular order, but
plug-ins as a whole will load last.

> NOTE: plug-ins do not currently load last. This is changing as more of the
> shell system is moving toward plug-in definitions.

## Inspiration

The basic structure was originally based on Ryan Bates's dotfile
configurations, but my own biases and influences from other example
repositories have been adopted here making regular merges impossible.

I have liberally taken inspiration and code from the following projects,
repositories and other places on the 'net that I'm not even sure of anymore.
